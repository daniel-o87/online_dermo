phase 1 - basic web deployment (2-3 weeks):

learn fastapi basics
quick react frontend w/ image upload
dockerize both
basic github actions pipeline
deploy on smth cheap like digitalocean

phase 2 - ml infrastructure (3-4 weeks):

wrap your model in fastapi endpoints
set up model versioning w/ mlflow
basic s3 bucket setup for model storage
implement basic logging + monitoring
containerize the ml service

phase 3 - data engineering (4-5 weeks):

learn spark basics for data processing
set up basic airflow DAGs
create ETL pipeline for new training data
implement basic model retraining logic

phase 4 - production hardening (4 weeks):

redis for caching responses
proper monitoring w/ prometheus + grafana
load testing w/ locust
proper error handling + fallbacks
security hardening

tech stack you NEED to learn:
plaintextCopylanguages:
- python (fastapi, pyspark)
- javascript/typescript (react)

infra:
- docker + docker-compose
- basic aws (s3, ecs)
- redis
- mlflow

ci/cd:
- github actions
- basic kubernetes concepts

monitoring:
- prometheus
- grafana
pro tips:

start w/ monolith, break into microservices later
use managed services early (don't self-host redis etc)
DOCUMENT everything from day 1
write tests before adding complexity

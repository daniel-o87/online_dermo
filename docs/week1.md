# Skin Cancer Detection Project - Technical Challenges & Learnings

## Model Performance Challenges

### Initial Accuracy Issues
- Initial testing revealed poor model performance with only 30% accuracy on validation set
- Highlighted need for significant improvements in data preprocessing and feature engineering

### Data Preprocessing Insights
#### Age Feature Engineering
- **Problem Identified**: Raw age values created artificial distinctions
  - Example: Model treated ages 20 and 21 as completely different features
  - Led to poor generalization and unnecessary complexity
- **Solution Approach**: Age range categorization
  - Implementing age brackets (20-25, 26-30, etc.)
  - Reduces feature space while maintaining meaningful age-related patterns
  - More closely aligns with medical risk factor groupings

## Technical Implementation Challenges

### FastAPI Integration
- Successfully set up basic endpoint structure
- Initial testing revealed need for:
  - More robust error handling
  - Better input validation
  - Performance optimization for image processing

### Data Pipeline Considerations
- Need to ensure consistency between:
  - Training data preprocessing
  - Real-time inference preprocessing
  - Age bracket transformations must be identical in both scenarios

## Next Steps and Improvements

### Model Retraining Strategy
1. Implement new age bracketing system
2. Reassess other categorical features for similar optimization
3. Retrain model with preprocessed data
4. Validate against test set with focus on:
   - Overall accuracy
   - False positive/negative rates
   - Performance across different age groups

### Web Interface Development
- Continue development of user interface
- Implement:
  - Real-time data validation
  - Clear result presentation
  - Error handling and user feedback
